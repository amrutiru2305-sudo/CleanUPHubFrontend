--------------------------------------------------------**CLEANUP HUB**--------------------------------------------------------------



**OVERVIEW:**

CleanUP Hub is a community-driven digital platform that promotes cleanliness. It simplifies the process of reporting garbage buildup and organizing volunteer cleanup efforts. As a full-stack web application, CleanUP Hub acts as a central hub where citizens, volunteers, and administrators can work together to improve local sanitation.
The platform aims to make environmental upkeep participatory and based on data. It allows citizens to report dirty areas by uploading images and GPS-tagged locations. Volunteers can sign up for cleanup events, while administrators handle reported issues and assign tasks.
